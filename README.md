## Description

This project was done to organize the structure of an html and css file. The purpose for reorganization was to make it more optimized for search engines and allow for more accessibility. The HTML file was given semantics elements to replace a lot of the non-semantics elements. Images were given alt attributes. The css file was also sightly changed so that it would work with the changes in the HTML file. I was given the initial starter code and did not create the website. There is a link in the credits to original code.
